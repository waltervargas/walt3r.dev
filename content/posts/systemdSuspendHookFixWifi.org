#+title: Systemd Suspend Hook to Fix WiFi Arch Linux

My macbook running Arch Linux is currently having problems with the
WiFi after resume from suspend.

Systemd provides a mechanism to run executable files before and after
suspend or hibernation.  =/usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep=

This mechanism relies on the system service =systemd-suspend.service=,
this service will run all executable files in
=/usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/=.

Two arguments are going to be passed to the script, before suspend the
execution will look to something like:

#+begin_src bash
/usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/wifi-hook.sh "pre" "suspend"
#+end_src

After suspend, the execution will be:

#+begin_src bash
/usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/wifi-hook.sh "post" "suspend"
#+end_src

Is up to you the implementation details, I just wrote a quick hackish
bash script:

#+begin_src bash
  #!/bin/sh

  _log () {
      echo "[$0] $1" | systemd-cat
  }

  _stop_wifi () {
    if nmcli networking off; then
        _log "Network stoped via nmcli"
    else
        _log "Error stopping network via nmcli"
    fi

    if modprobe -r wl; then
        _log "Kernel module [wl] removed"
    else
        _log "Error removing kernel module [wl]"
    fi
  }

  _start_wifi () {
      if modprobe wl; then
          _log "Kernel module [wl] loaded"
      else
          _log "Error loading Kernel module [wl]"
      fi

      if nmcli networking on; then
          _log "Network set to ON via nmcli"
      else
          _log "Error while setting Network to ON via nmcli"
      fi
  }

  _pre () {
      _stop_wifi
  }

  _post () {
      _start_wifi
  }

  main () {
      if [[ "$2" == "suspend" ]];
         case "$1" in
             pre)
                 _pre
                 ;;
             post)
                 _post
                 ;;
         esac
      fi
  }

  main "$@"
#+end_src

This scripts are intented for local use and hacks, if you want to
react to system suspend/hibernation and resume from applications you
should use [[https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/inhibit/][Inhibitor Interface]]
